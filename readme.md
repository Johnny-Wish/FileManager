# Java Course Experiment

## Author Information
This is the Course Experiment of Java Programming by Shueheng Liu (Stduent ID 20154625).

## Attention
The codes require a Unix (Linux, MacOS) platform to work properly due to file path format limitations. 

i.e., Running the codes on a Windows platform will not yield desired behaviour. 

## Package Content - Brief Introduction
File-managing is implemented in both Command Line Interface (see the `CLI` package) and Graphic User Interface (see the `GUI` package)

run the `main(String[])` method of `src/CLI/Console.java` to see the CLI behaviour (Unix Platform required)

run the `main(String[])` method of `src/GUI/FileBrowserWindow.java` to see the GUI behaviour (Unix Platform required)

## Functionality (with relevant CLI commands)
1. copying files/folders (`cp`) 

2. deleting files / empty dirs (`rm`)

3. creating new directories (`mkdir`)

4. viewing files (`cat`)

5. changing directory (`cd`)

6. pring working directory (`pwd`)

7. listing directory contents (`ls`)

8. encrypting files (`encrypt`)

9. decrypting files (`decrypt`)

10. zipping folders (`zip`)

11. unzipping folders (`unzip`)

12. reveal file/folder in parent Dir (`locate`)

13. open file (`open`)

## Demonstration
In Video `FileManagerDemo-Compressed.mp4`, the functions of `1.`, `2.`, `3.`, `4.`, `5.`, `6.`, `7.`, `8.`, `9.`, `10.`, and `11.` are demonstrated.

In Video `locate-and-open-binary-files-Compressed.mp4`, the functions of `12.` and `13.` are demonstrated.
