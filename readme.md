# Java Course Experiment

## Author Info 
This is the Course Experiment of Java Programming by Shueheng Liu (Stduent ID 20154625).

## Attention!!!
The codes require a Unix (Linux, MacOS) platform to work properly due to file path format limitations. Running the codes on a Windows platform will not yield desired behaviour. 

## Package Content - Brief Intro
File-managing is implemented in both Command Line Interface (see the `CLI` package) and Graphic User Interface (see the `GUI` package)

run the `main(String[])` method of `src/CLI/Console.java` to see the CLI behaviour (Unix Platform required)

run the `main(String[])` method of `src/GUI/FileBrowserWindow.java` to see the GUI behaviour (Unix Platform required)

## Functionality
copying files/folders (cp) 

deleting files / empty dirs (rm)

creating new directories (mkdir)

viewing files (cat)

changing directory (cd)

pring working directory (pwd)

listing directory contents (ls)

encrypting files (encrypt)

decrypting files (decrypt)
